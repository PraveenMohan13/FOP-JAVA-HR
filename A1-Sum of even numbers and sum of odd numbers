Sum of even numbers and sum of odd numbers
Arun and Kalai were playing a puzzle game with a given set of numbers. They need to find the odd and even numbers and find the sum of the odd numbers and the sum of the even numbers. Write a program to help them to solve the puzzle game and to win the mobile phone.
Input Format:

Input consists of n+1 integers. 

The first integer corresponds to ‘n’, the size of the array. 

The next ‘n’ integers correspond to the elements in the array. 

Assume that the maximum value of n is 15.



Output Format:

Refer to sample output for details.



Sample Input:

5

2

3

6

8

-1



Sample Output:

The sum of the even numbers in the array is 16

The sum of the odd numbers in the array is 2
